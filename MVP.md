## MVP (Minimum Viable Product):

## Goal:

-- Build an app focused on building positive community experiences where users are able to sign-up and connect with other people (friends, romantic partners, or solo) through in-app messaging as well as attending events or group activities related to common interests. We will be using React Native, Firebase, Heroku, Google Maps API (or any other map API), Expo (Mobile), Sockets, Bootstrap (or Tailwind), and MaterialUI.

## User Stories (Users Should Be Able To - USBAT):

-- Create/Edit/Delete their own profile
-- Post/Edit/Delete an event
-- Mark attendance for an event and receive reminder notifications
-- Mark “Interested” for an event and receive reminder notifications
-- Swipe through a list of people or events that they have been matched to based on location/proximity or interest
-- Create/Approve/Deny Friend Requests
-- Block/Unblock other users
-- Send messages to users in friend list
-- Sign In/Sign Out
-- Search for People and Events

## Proof of concept:

-- Location
-- Sockets for Chat
-- Sharing links from app to other people
-- Page for List of Events that link to an event page <SingleEventPage /> lol (Post events with an event page)
-- Authentication (Users) & DB
-- Way to match with other users based on preferences/mutual interest (NoSQL - Firebase)
-- Notifications for people matching, messages, new events (?)
-- Sending device id and app id to push notification

## Features:

-- Maps
-- Swiping People & Events
-- Chat
-- Live Feed / NewsFeed / “What’s New” / Events (Possible Landing Page)
-- Rate and Be Rated (Events and People)
-- Searching for Events & People

## Stretch goals:

-- Complex algorithms for array of people to swipe on
-- Reviews for people
-- Safety & Accessibility Features (location sharing, emergency contacts, Panic Button - 911 Dispatcher: how to build to prevent accidental requests?)
-- Purchase event tickets in-app? (for personal events or even business)
-- If user has multiple “bad” events, account gets flagged for investigation
-- See the pins of friends list on map based on events they are attending
