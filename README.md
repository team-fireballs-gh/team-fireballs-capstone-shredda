# HangOut

#### A social app that connects users by centering community connection through events and activities that are close to both users. Users can choose how they want to use the app (*romance, friendship, solo*).

#### Built with *React Native Expo*, *Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Storage)* and a variety of **APIs** (react-native-deck-swiper, react-native-gifted-chat, expo-image-picker, react-native-maps, react-native-google-places-autocomplete, datetimepicker). 

#### Using the knowledge and foundation we gained from the bootcamp to build a fullstack React web app, we were able to quickly adapt and navigate new documentation that allowed us to build a fullstack iOS React-Native mobile app. During the process of this project, we practiced clear and consistent communication within a remote setting across different time zones. By doing so, we successfully created a positive and supportive work environment ðŸ˜Š.
